This site contains the project documentation for the
'Calculators' project that is used mainly for individual
tax calculation purposes. Its aim is to provide users
with a fairly accurate amount of tax paid, given the
financial year and calculator.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.

## Acknowledgements
I want to thank my house plants for providing me with
a negligible amount of oxygen each day. Also, I want
to thank the sun for providing more than half of their
nourishment free of charge.
